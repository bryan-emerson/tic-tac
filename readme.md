## How to play:

The classic rules of Tic Tac Toe apply! You will either be Blue or Red. Get three of a row in your color and you win! The text at the top of the board will say who's turn it is. When it is your turn, use the cursor to click on a square that has not been clicked yet. That square will turn your color. The text on top of the board will now indicate it is the other player's turn, and they can now click a square that has not been clicked. First player to three in a row wins!
